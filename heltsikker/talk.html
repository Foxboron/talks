How do we know someone has no published a malicious package?

How do we know if a package release is

Imagen if signing keys are compromised! Someone could create fake and malicious packages which are completely valid
packages.

Signing keys from fedora has been compromised in 2008. Compromised Openssh package.
https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008:0855

Debian has signed repository databases.

Arch Linux has no signed repository databases and sign each package with personal keys.

Publishing release logs? Can be changed, no signatures.

- Transparency logs!
    
    - Binary tree

    - Based on merkle trees

    - RFC 6962: Certificate Transparency

- Root nodes are always signed

- Leafs are hashed data

- Interior nodes are hashes of the left and right hash
]

???

Popularized by certificate transparency.

All browser use CT.

Gives the browser "Signed Certificate Timestamps", SCT.

Ensures validity. 

Needs to be commited to the tree.

Ensures that all certs needs to enter the log.

Enables Certificate Authorities to monitor the log for compromised signing keys.

Transparency logs as a general datastructure! trillian from google

Used in multiple projects to provide custom transparency logs

## Creating the node
```python
>>> import hashlib
>>> hashlib.sha256(b"Somedata").hexdigest()
'7d877045f48746bf47d52bca95e2e7325ee917323b51200a3d57bd87...'
>>> hashlib.sha256(b"Someother").hexdigest()
'90f811d519edeb2df81e0cd0180cde681a39e38b29bc2579f5f956b0...'
>>> hashlib.sha256(b"7d877045..."+b"90f811d5...").hexdigest()
'12c019f2d4b5a100e297ba053b352203c465202ece61ebb968380831...'
```

Secure hashing function! Ensures no collisions.

- Audit proof

    - Is the hash part of the tree? 

- Consistency proof

    - Is the old tree a subset of the current tree?

### Requires:
- Some signed tree root

- Number of leafs
